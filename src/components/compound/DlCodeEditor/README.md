# DlCodeEditor

The DlCodeEditor component is based off the [simple-code-editor](https://github.com/justcaliturner/simple-code-editor) written by [Vic](https://github.com/justcaliturner)

#### Modifications

The code itself was modified a bit to support vue 2.6 and vue3 together using the library vue-demi and general vue changes.

1. moved to composition api
2. used vue-demi to support transition between library versions
3. used library version agnostic terms and behaviors
4. use custom components for the header and other elements
